\title{
Nonparametric Test of Independence
}
\description{
In output based efficiency measurement, routine \code{nptestind} perform test that radial (Debreu-Farrell) output-based measure of technical efficiency under chosen assumption about the technology and mix of outputs are independent. In input-based efficiency measurement, routine \code{nptestind} perform test that radial (Debreu-Farrell) input-based measure of technical efficiency under chosen assumption about the technology and mix of inputs are independent. Testing is performed using bootstrap technique.

\usage{
nptestind(formula, data, subset,
 rts = c("C", "NI", "V"), base = c("output", "input"),
 reps = 999, alpha = 0.05,
 print.level = 1, dots = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{
an object of class ``formula'' (or one that can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the model. The details of model specification are given under `Details'.
}
\item{data}{
an optional data frame containing the variables in the model. If not found in data, the variables are taken from environment (\code{formula}), typically the environment from which \code{teradial} is called.
}
\item{subset}{
an optional vector specifying a subset of observations for which technical efficiency is to be computed.
}
\item{rts}{
character or numeric. string: first letter of the word ``c'' for constant, ``n'' for non-increasing, or ``v'' for variable returns to scale assumption. numeric: 3 for constant, 2 for non-increasing, or 1 for variable returns to scale assumption. 
}
\item{base}{
character or numeric. string: first letter of the word ``o'' for computing output-based or ``i'' for computing input-based technical efficiency measure. string: 2 for computing output-based or 1 for computing input-based technical efficiency measure
}
\item{reps}{
specifies the number of bootstrap replications to be performed.  The default is 999.  The minimum is 100.  Adequate estimates of confidence intervals using bias-corrected methods typically require 1,000 or more replications.
}
\item{alpha}{
sets significance level; default is \code{alpha=0.05}.
}
\item{dots}{
logical. Relevant if \code{print.level>=1}. If TRUE, one dot character is displayed for each successful replication; if FALSE,  display of the replication dots is suppressed.
}
\item{print.level}{
numeric. 0 - nothing is printed; 1 - print summary of the model and data. 2 - print summary of technical efficiency measures. 3 - print estimation results observation by observation. Default is 1.
}
}
\details{
In output based efficiency measurement, routine \code{nptestind} perform test that radial (Debreu-Farrell) output-based measure of technical efficiency under chosen assumption about the technology and mix of outputs are independent. In input-based efficiency measurement, routine \code{nptestind} perform test that radial (Debreu-Farrell) input-based measure of technical efficiency under chosen assumption about the technology and mix of inputs are independent.

Testing is performed using bootstrap technique (see Wilson, 2003).

numeric: number of inputs.
}
\item{rts}{
string: RTS assumption.
}
\item{base}{
string: base for efficiency measurement.
}
\item{reps}{
numeric: number of bootstrap replications.
