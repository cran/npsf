 Nonradial Measure of Technical Efficiency, the Russell Measure
}
\description{
Routine \code{tenonradial} uses reduced linear programming to compute the nonradial output- or input-based measure of technical efficiency, which is known as the Russell measure. In input-based nonradial efficiency measurement, this measure allows for non-proportional/different reductions in each positive input, and this is what permits it to shrink an input vector all the way back to the efficient subset. In output-based nonradial efficiency measurement, the Russell measure allows for non-proportional/different expansions of each positive output.

\usage{
tenonradial(formula, data, subset,
 rts = c("C", "NI", "V"), 
 base = c("output", "input"), 
 ref = NULL, data.ref = NULL, subset.ref = NULL,
 full.solution = TRUE,
 print.level = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{
an object of class ``formula'' (or one that can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the model. The details of model specification are given under `Details'.
}
\item{data}{
an optional data frame containing the variables in the model. If not found in data, the variables are taken from environment (\code{formula}), typically the environment from which \code{tenonradial} is called.
}
\item{subset}{
an optional vector specifying a subset of observations for which technical efficiency is to be computed.
}
\item{rts}{
character or numeric. string: first letter of the word ``c'' for constant, ``n'' for non-increasing, or ``v'' for variable returns to scale assumption. numeric: 3 for constant, 2 for non-increasing, or 1 for variable returns to scale assumption.  
}
\item{base}{
character or numeric. string: first letter of the word ``o'' for computing output-based or ``i'' for computing input-based technical efficiency measure. string: 2 for computing output-based or 1 for computing input-based technical efficiency measure
}
\item{ref}{
an object of class ``formula'' (or one that can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of inputs and outputs that are used to define the technology reference set. The details of technology reference set specification are given under `Details'. If reference is not provided, the technical efficiency measures for data points are computed relative to technology based on data points themselves.
}
\item{data.ref}{
an optional data frame containing the variables in the technology reference set. If not found in \code{data.ref}, the variables are taken from environment(ref), typically the environment from which \code{tenonradial} is called.
}
\item{subset.ref}{
an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to define the technology reference set.
}
\item{full.solution}{
 logical. The detailed solution is returned.  See \code{value} section.
 }
\item{print.level}{
numeric. 0 - nothing is printed; 1 - print summary of the model and data. 2 - print summary of technical efficiency measures. 3 - print estimation results observation by observation. Default is 1.
}
}
\details{
Routine \code{tenonradial} computes the nonradial output- or input-based measure of technical efficiency under assumption of constant, non-increasing, or variable returns to scale technology. The details of the estimator can be found e.g., in Färe, Grosskopf, and Lovell (1994) or Badunenko and Mozharovskyi (2020), \doi{10.1080/01605682.2019.1599778}.

Models for \code{tenonradial} are specified symbolically. A typical model has the form \code{outputs ~ inputs}, where \code{outputs} (\code{inputs}) is a series of (numeric) terms which specifies outputs (inputs). The same goes for reference set.  Refer to the examples.

Results can be summarized using \code{\link{summary.npsf}}.
}

\value{
\code{tenonradial} returns a list of class \code{npsf} containing the following elements:
\item{model}{
string: model name.
}
\item{K}{
numeric: number of data points for which efficiency is estimated.
}
\item{M}{
numeric: number of outputs.
}
\item{N}{
numeric: number of inputs.
}
\item{Kref}{
numeric: number of data points in the reference.
}
\item{rts}{
string: RTS assumption.
}
\item{base}{
string: base for efficiency measurement.
}
\item{te}{
numeric: nonradial measure (Russell) of technical efficiency.
}
\item{te.detail}{
numeric: \code{K x ncol} matrix containing thetas or lambdas for \code{ncol} outputs (output-based) or inputs (input-based). \code{ncol} is \code{M} for output- and \code{N} for input-based efficiency measurement.
}
\item{intensity}{
numeric: \code{K x Kref} matrix containing the intensity variables \code{z}. These can be used to identify peers.
}
\item{esample}{
logical: returns TRUE if the observation in user supplied data is in the estimation subsample and FALSE otherwise.
}
\item{esample.ref}{
logical: returns TRUE if the observation in the user supplied reference is in the reference subsample and FALSE otherwise.
}
}

\note{
In case of one input (output), the input (output)-based Russell measure is equal to Debrue-Farrell (\code{\link{teradial}}) measure of technical efficiency.

Results can be summarized using \code{\link{summary.npsf}}.
