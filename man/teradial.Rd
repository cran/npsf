\title{
Radial Measure of Technical Efficiency, the Debrue-Farrell Measure
}
\description{
Routine \code{teradial} computes radial Debrue-Farrell input- or output-based measure of efficiency via reduced linear programing. In input-based radial efficiency measurement, this measure allows for proportional reductions in each positive input, and this is what permits it to shrink an input vector all the way back to the efficient subset. In output-based radial efficiency measurement, the Debrue-Farrell measure allows for proportional expansions of each positive output.

\usage{
teradial(formula, data, subset,
 rts = c("C", "NI", "V"),
 base = c("output", "input"),
 ref = NULL, data.ref = NULL, subset.ref = NULL,
 print.level = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{
an object of class ``formula'' (or one that can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the model. The details of model specification are given under `Details'.
}
\item{data}{
an optional data frame containing the variables in the model. If not found in data, the variables are taken from environment (\code{formula}), typically the environment from which \code{teradial} is called.
}
\item{subset}{
an optional vector specifying a subset of observations for which technical efficiency is to be computed.
}
\item{rts}{
character or numeric. string: first letter of the word ``c'' for constant, ``n'' for non-increasing, or ``v'' for variable returns to scale assumption. numeric: 3 for constant, 2 for non-increasing, or 1 for variable returns to scale assumption.
}
\item{base}{
character or numeric. string: first letter of the word ``o'' for computing output-based or ``i'' for computing input-based technical efficiency measure. string: 2 for computing output-based or 1 for computing input-based technical efficiency measure
}
\item{ref}{
an object of class ``formula'' (or one that can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of inputs and outputs that are used to define the technology reference set. The details of technology reference set specification are given under `Details'. If reference is not provided, the technical efficiency measures for data points are computed relative to technology based on data points themselves.
}
\item{data.ref}{
an optional data frame containing the variables in the technology reference set. If not found in \code{data.ref}, the variables are taken from environment(ref), typically the environment from which \code{teradial} is called.
}
\item{subset.ref}{
an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to define the technology reference set.
}
\item{print.level}{
numeric. 0 - nothing is printed; 1 - print summary of the model and data. 2 - print summary of technical efficiency measures. 3 - print estimation results observation by observation. Default is 1.
}
}
\details{
Routine \code{teradial} computes the radial output- or input-based measure of technical efficiency under assumption of constant, non-increasing, or variable returns to scale technology. The details of the estimator can be found e.g., in Färe, Grosskopf, and Lovell (1994, especially section 3.1 on p.62 fot input-based and section 4.1 on p.96 for output-based efficiency measurement) or Badunenko and Mozharovskyi (2016) <\url{http://www.stata-journal.com/article.html?article=st0444}>.

Models for \code{teradial} are specified symbolically. A typical model has the form \code{outputs ~ inputs}, where \code{outputs} (\code{inputs}) is a series of (numeric) terms which specifies outputs (inputs). The same goes for reference set.  Refer to the examples.

Results can be summarized using \code{\link{summary.npsf}}.
}

\value{
\code{teradial} returns a list of class \code{npsf} containing the following elements:
\item{K}{
numeric: number of data points.
}
\item{M}{
numeric: number of outputs.
}
\item{N}{
numeric: number of inputs.
}
\item{rts}{
string: RTS assumption.
}
\item{base}{
string: base for efficiency measurement.
}
\item{te}{
numeric: radial measure (Debrue-Farrell) of technical efficiency.
}
\item{esample}{
logical: returns TRUE if the observation in user supplied data is in the estimation subsample and FALSE otherwise.
}
\item{esample.ref}{
logical: returns TRUE if the observation in the user supplied reference is in the reference subsample and FALSE otherwise.
}
}

\note{
In case of one input (output), the input (output)-based Debrue-Farrell measure is equal to  Russell  measure of technical efficiency (see \code{\link{tenonradial}}).

Results can be summarized using \code{\link{summary.npsf}}.
